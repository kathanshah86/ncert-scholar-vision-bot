Chapter 7: Cell Structure and Functions

The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells.
Cells vary in their shape, size, and function. However, all cells share some common features.

Key Points:
1. The cell was first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665.
2. The cell theory states that:
   - All living organisms are composed of cells
   - The cell is the basic unit of life
   - All cells arise from pre-existing cells`,

  "math-equation": `Linear Equations

A linear equation in one variable can be written in the form:
ax + b = c

Where a, b, and c are constants, and a â‰  0.

Examples:
1. 2x + 3 = 7
2. 5x - 2 = 13

To solve:
Step 1: Move all terms with the variable to one side
Step 2: Move all other terms to the opposite side
Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable`,

  "history-text": `The Indus Valley Civilization

The Indus Valley Civilization was one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, existing from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. Its mature period lasted from 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE.

Major cities included Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, which showed advanced urban planning with:
- Grid-like street patterns
- Sophisticated drainage systems
- Great Bath structures
- Granaries for food storage

The civilization is known for its:
1. Standardized weights and measures
2. Advanced metallurgy
3. Seals with script that has not been fully deciphered`,
